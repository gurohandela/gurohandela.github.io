        <p class="about_text">Here you have an overview of what I have done as a designer. It is a display of my diversity and projects using different design methodologies. I have found the agile process very helpful in projects, and I am a fan of iteration. I have used there IT principles also in my more pure graphical works. <br>

                <p>In the spring of 2020, I and 5 fellow students created Fimafeng - an app for mapping the oceans movements (high and low tide). Through
                    user surveys, continuous testing, and programming, we created an app designed to assist boat users and owners
                    at sea and on land. It provided clear information and alerts about significant changes in tides. We received an
                    honorable mention for the best app idea from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.</p>

                <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                <p>This project was my first encounter with agile development. Our team came from 4 different study disciplines. We
                    conducted the process digitally, as the whole world was in a Corona lockdown. The process was carried out using
                    ScrumBan, with a retrospective approach to user surveys, requirements, and modeling.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Through user surveys and document analysis, we identified the needs for security and information gathering within our
                    user group. Our requirements were developed based on this and possible operational solutions.</p>

                <div class="img_grid">
                    <p>We used use case models to understand how we could use the APIs</p>

                <h3><small>Design Process</small></h3>
                <p>In this project, there were two designers. During the Scrum intervals, we worked on data collection, analysis of
                    the data material, and clarification of requirements. Data collection and testing were conducted through surveys and
                    interviews. At the beginning of the process, we focused more on data collection, and towards
                    the end, our focus shiftet towards requirements, aesthetic design, and user testing.</p>
                
                <h3><small>Challenges & Lessons Learned</small></h3>
                <p>I experienced that the structure of ScrumBan helps unfamiliar people get to know each other and provides form and
                    structure to digital collaboration. Structure keeps the process on track and helps us resolve any disagreements that
                    arise. 
                    <br></br>We resolved a significant disagreement through a joint meeting, resulting in a commitment to clearer
                    communication and slightly less role differentiation. We were supposed to deliver a product together, and we decided
                    that our ideas should be discussed collectively. However, the distinction between designer and developer, and vice
                    versa, didn't need to be as significant as we initially determined in our project.</p>

                <p>In the spring of 2021, I and 2 fellow students created ReMake - an app concept for material and project access. The
                    project aimed to reduce material overconsumption by increasing local expertise and production. We had the following problem
                    statement:</p>
                
                <p><i>How can creative projects at Elvebakken Makerspace facilitate socialization and promote conscious
                        upcycling?</i></p>

                <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                <p>The project was conducted in iterations, with the Transition Design framework as a guideline. It has the following
                    main focuses: <i>Visions of transition, Specify user needs, Produce design solutions, and Evaluate design solutions</i>. 
                    <br> We combined this framework with the classic user oriented process. This way, sustainability and user concerns became a combined focus.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Through participatory design, we identified the following needs. We conducted the workshops on Zoom, using Miro Boards
                    as interaction tool for collaborative ideation processes. Each iteration had different focus areas.</p>

                <p>This project provided me with more insight into how system theory can be used to understand design influence to the
                    society. The Transition Design framework is meant to be used to push society in a more sustainable direction through design. Design creates change, and we experienced this firsthand. Our biggest eureka moment
                    was that even a participatory design process creates change, because our participants became more aware and changed their habits through the design
                    process.</p>

                    <p>In the spring of 2019, I and four fellow students created a prototype for a tactile sound shower at the Viking Ship
                        Museum. We addressed the following research question:</p>
                    <p><i>Can we influence the experience of exhibition objects at the Viking Ship Museum by facilitating the use of multiple
                        senses?</i></p>

                            <p>Midlun is intended to be a stationary system in front of an exhibition object at the Viking Ship Museum. Midlun
                                consists of a hemisphere covered in synthetic leather. When you stand underneath Midlun, you will hear Viking-themed
                                music. You feel wind on your face, and if you look up, you will see a starry sky. On each side, there is a braided
                                wire. These are two capacitive sensors that function as an "on"/"off" button. If you press "on", a narrator's voice
                                will start telling you about the object you are standing in front of. <br>
                            
                            </br> Midlun takes you back to the Viking Age by stimulating multiple senses simultaneously: hearing, sight, tactility, and spatial awareness. It provides a
                                sense of belonging by being able to be used by up to 3 people at the same time, and fulfills the need for
                                self-realization by allowing you to decide to get more information about the object you are facing. Midlun
                                influences the experience of an exhibition object at the Viking Ship Museum by enabling the user to engage multiple
                                senses.</p>

                                    while also talking with curator-professors from the University of Oslo. Our target audience was young people between
                                    20-30 years old. We held focus groups, interviews, and tested prototypes with the target audience. The evaluations
                                    we conducted followed the prototypes' degree of fidelity.</p>

            <p>This project was my first user oriented design project. The opportunities within this design framework are extensive.
                Halfway through the project, we had a great need to change direction in the design of the product that we had
                initially envisioned. This gave us good experience in letting ourselves be guided by the data and its findings,
                rather than assuming what the target audience actually needs.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 2022, I created labels for Hindø Coffee Roastery's coffee collection at Trevarefabrikken. The
                    goal of the design was to capture the intersection between the nature of Lofoten and the coffee's country of origin.

                <p>The design was created in Figma during Spring, through iterations and customer evaluations of
                    different sketches. Inspiration was drawn from bus trips through the Lofoten Mountains and studies of Colombian, Brazilian,
                    and Ethiopian coffee culture. Brazilian coffee is known for its nutty flavor, Ethiopian coffee for its fruity notes,
                    and Colombian coffee falls somewhere in between. This, along with the cultural influences of these countries,
                    determined the final design choices.</p>

                        coffee from Trevarefabrikken. It gained attention throughout the summer, resulting in more coffee sales than
                        before. It was also immensely enjoyable as a designer to translate inspiration from nature into something tangible
                        on paper.</p>

                            <p>We had a desire to illustrate price and product in a simple, stylish manner. Trevarefabrikken had some
                                unique items on the menu and wanted to establish a connection between the customer and the product without it
                                feeling intrusive. I solved this by outlining characteristic lines of the product on the touchpad. The design was always close to Trevarefabrikken's design system.</p>

                        <p>In the spring of 2023, I designed the website for the artisan and ceramicist Cecilie Haaland. It was created in close
                            collaboration with the artist. You can see the result <a href="https://www.ceciliehaaland.no/">here.</a></a></p>
                        <p>Cecilie Haaland's website needed to reflect her as an artisan. It draws inspiration from the client's workspace and its established design system. At the same time, it carries Haaland's distinctive style by mirroring her way of presenting art through juxtaposition combined with minimalism.</p>
                            
                                            
                        <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                        <p>It was important that the client could edit the website on their own after my involvement. The result was a Wix-made
                            website where I created the design system and then set up the current website for the client. The client personally
                            selected images and wrote informational texts. When I proposed a design, it was evaluated through client reviews
                            with corrections and change suggestions.</p>

                        <h3><small>Challenges & Lessons learned</small></h3>
                        <p>The key to success when creating a website and working closely with a client is
                            communication. Additionally, spending enough time with the client to understand their preferences is crucial. This
                            is especially important when collaborating with artists, where their art, their life's work, is to be presented in
                            a domain they may not feel comfortable with. This work required humility and flexibility, combined with clear
                            communication about what each of us needed from the other. This project demanded patience, as the product was
                            created at the intersection of myself and Cecilie Haaland.</p>

                            <p>In the summer of 2023, I designed a template layout for Tringa Birding's website. Tringa Birding is a company that offers
                                birdwatching throughout Norway.</p>

                        <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                        <p>In this assignment, I was hired to create a template structure for the website. Since the client had already
                            decided on the design, the design process was based on the client's proposed website structure. It was crucial that
                            the owner of the company could edit and make changes to it on their own after the design period. He was familiar
                            with WordPress, and we therefore chose that as the publishing platform.</p>

                        <p>My work during the process involved guiding the client in editing WordPress. I also worked as a consultant in
                            decisions regarding plugins, publishing, and marketing. Communication with the client was primarily conducted over
                            the phone, as we usually didn't have the opportunity to meet in person.</p>

                        <h3><small>Challenges & Lessons learned</small></h3>
                        <p>In this collaboration, I worked extensively on designing templates and block-defined
                            layouts. At the same time, I gained experience in domain switching and creation.</p>
